# CS160: Computer Science Orientation

## Course Description
CS160 introduces the fundamental concepts of computer science and its applications. The course covers problem-solving techniques, basic programming concepts, and an overview of computer hardware and software. It also provides an introduction to teamwork in software development and the essential tools for success in the OSU Computer Science program.

## Course Objectives
- Explain the field of computer science and the roles of computer scientists.
- Utilize computers for communication, research, and productivity.
- Identify and cite sources of current computer science information.
- Develop a study plan leading to a B.S. degree in Computer Science.
- Solve problems using abstraction and modularization.
- Recognize basic computer hardware components and explain their functions.
- Differentiate between software types (e.g., open-source vs. proprietary, system vs. application).
- Install and manage software while addressing security concerns (e.g., viruses, spam).
- Gain proficiency with tools essential for success in further CS coursework.
- Work collaboratively to design a simple software system.

## Projects

### Number System Converter
**Objective:** Develop a Python program that converts between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems. 
- Users can select conversion operations.
- Input validation ensures correctness.
- The interface is user-friendly and allows multiple operations in a session.
- Restricted to basic Python functions (e.g., typecasting, print, input, range, len).
- No global variables or nested function definitions.

### Data Analysis Programs
**Letter Frequency Analysis**
- Accepts a list of names from the user.
- Analyzes letter frequencies (case-insensitive) and displays results.

**List Comparison Tool**
- Accepts two lists of integers.
- Compares length, sum, and common elements.

- Programs are modular, error-handle invalid inputs, and adhere to function limitations.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
**Objective:** Implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Players input their names and take turns placing ‘X’ or ‘O’ on a 3x3 board.
- The game detects a win, tie, and allows replay.
- Tracks win statistics for each player.
- Input validation ensures correct entries.

## Labs

### Looping
**Averages**
- Continuously prompts for numbers until the user stops.
- Computes and displays the average.

**Restricted Averages**
- Only accepts positive decimal values.

**Palindrome Checker**
- Determines if a given string is a palindrome.

**Restricted Palindrome Checker**
- Ensures input contains only letters (no numbers).

### Functions (Calculator)
**Objective:** Design a calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and averaging.
- Users select operations and input values.
- Prevents division by zero errors.
- Allows multiple calculations per session.

### Password Generator
**Objective:** Create a program that generates passwords based on user-specified parameters.
- User selects password length, allowed special characters, and number of uppercase letters.
- Uses random functions to generate secure passwords.

## Implementation Guidelines
- All programs must be written in Python 3.
- Limited built-in functions (e.g., typecasting, print, input, range, len, append).
- Functions cannot exceed 15 lines.
- No exception handling.
- No global variables; only `main()` should be called in the global scope.

This README provides an overview of CS160, outlining course objectives, projects, and labs. Each project and lab is designed to reinforce fundamental problem-solving and programming skills in Python.
